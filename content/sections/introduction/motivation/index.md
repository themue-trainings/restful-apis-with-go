## Existing libraries

* Several libraries are already available for RESTful APIs:
    * [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com)
    * [chi](https://go-chi.io/#/)
    * [Gorilla web toolkit](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org)
    * And more ...
* But using one of these libraries is not always the best choice
    * Some are to complex to use
    * Some contain too many dependencies
    * Some are not well documented
    * Some are not well tested
    * Some are possibly not well maintained

## Own library

* It can be created according to own requirements
* It can be kept small and not trying to be as generic as possible
* Bugfixes and improvements can be made directly
* At least you learn how to implement a RESTful API
